For the University of Denver Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp students were tasked with creating a timed quiz.

The main challenges were getting a timer that behaved appropriately and displaying that timer on the page. To solve this problem, JavaScript and jQuery were once again the tools used. The main functions generate the quiz, start the quiz, govern the timer, and end the game once the timer hits 0 or the user signals that they're done.

My technical approach was to keep the codebase as lightweight as possible while making sure that the various functions were tied together appropriately.

Should you choose to take the quiz, here are some instructions:

Upon pressing the 'START' button, a quiz with 10 questions will appear. The quiz will end automatially once two minutes have passed or the 'DONE' button at the bottom of the quiz is pressed.

Once the quiz has ended, the user will be given a score showing correct, incorrect and unanswered questions.
